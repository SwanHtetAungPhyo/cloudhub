### üß† Amazon S3, Lambda & AWS Services ‚Äì DVA Quiz

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ A developer needs to securely serve private website content stored in S3 through CloudFront so users **cannot bypass** CloudFront. How should this be implemented?

* Use CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC) + update S3 bucket policy
* Enable S3 static website hosting + point CloudFront at bucket website endpoint
* Make the S3 bucket public and set CloudFront header to restrict
* Add a custom header to CloudFront origin + bucket policy with `aws:RequestTag`

<details>
<summary>üîΩ Reveal Answer</summary>

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** Use CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC) + update S3 bucket policy
This ensures content is served **only** via CloudFront, without exposing the S3 bucket directly ([examtopics.com][1], [examtopics.com][2], [examtopics.com][3], [jayendrapatil.com][4], [examtopics.com][5]).

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ A company has multiple branches uploading daily sales reports to an S3 bucket. A single Lambda processes all reports at the same time every day. What‚Äôs the **most cost-effective** trigger?

* S3 Event Notification on each upload
* Step Functions state machine scheduled
* Always-running Lambda waiting for time
* EventBridge scheduled rule at specified time

<details>
<summary>üîΩ Reveal Answer</summary>

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** EventBridge scheduled rule
EventBridge cron rule triggers the Lambda **once per day**, avoiding unnecessary invocations ([tutorialsdojo.com][6]).

</details>

#### 8Ô∏è‚É£ What is the **recommended way** for on-premises applications to securely access AWS services?

* Assign IAM role to on-prem server
* Create IAM user + store credentials in `~/.aws/credentials`
* Use STS AssumeRole from on-prem
* Use IAM user + hashed password in credentials file

<details>
<summary>üîΩ Reveal Answer</summary>

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** Create IAM user + store credentials in `~/.aws/credentials`
On-prem apps can't use IAM roles natively, so using long-term credentials in AWS credentials files is correct .

</details>

#### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Which solution ensures **automatic rotation** of database credentials for an RDS MySQL instance?

* Store credentials in environment variables and rotate AMIs
* Store credentials in Parameter Store with rotation

* EMR cluster to enrich ‚Üí upload to S3
* Use EventBridge Pipes to filter & enrich from SQS to fulfillment

<details>
<summary>üîΩ Reveal Answer</summary>

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** Use EventBridge Pipes
Pipes streamline SQS ‚Üí enrichment ‚Üí target flow with minimal code ([serverlessland.com][7], [examtopics.com][3]).

</details>

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ In EventBridge Pipes, what built-in step lets you add data to events before sending them to the target?

* Filter
* Input Transformer
* Enrichment
* Target Transformer

<details>
<summary>üîΩ Reveal Answer</summary>
